# 08 Wrap-up

## Starting point

```bash
git checkout checkpoint/08-wrap-up
```

You have walked through every loop step.

## What you should be able to do now

- Trace an LLM app end-to-end and read the result as a debugging surface.
- Connect prompts to traces so a prompt change has a measurable next-trace effect.
- Detect interesting production behavior (out-of-scope, disagreement) automatically.
- Turn product scope into a starter dataset of realistic examples.
- Run experiments on the same agent code with no parallel implementation.
- Compare runs after changes and decide which setup is better — by score and by reading individual outputs.


## Bigger picture

Langfuse in this workshop is a *shared surface*, not just observability:

- understanding behavior — every interaction is inspectable
- collecting representative examples — production seeds datasets
- comparing changes — every prompt or code change has a baseline
- improving systems continuously — the loop closes back on itself

## Good closing questions

- What did tracing reveal that was invisible before?
- Which production events would you monitor first in your own app?
- What would you add to the starter dataset next?
- What change would you test after the first prompt iteration?
- Where in your real app would the `/langfuse` skill have saved you the most hand-rolling?

## How to work on your own application

When you go back to your own codebase, do this in order:

1. **Run the [Langfuse CLI](https://langfuse.com/docs/api-and-data-platform/features/cli)** so you can manage prompts, datasets, and runs from the terminal. The CLI uses the same project API keys as the SDKs, so there is no separate CLI login step:

   ```bash
   export LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk-lf-..."
   export LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="sk-lf-..."
   export LANGFUSE_BASE_URL="https://cloud.langfuse.com"

   npx langfuse-cli api __schema
   ```

   If you prefer a global binary, install the published `langfuse-cli` package:

   ```bash
   npm install -g langfuse-cli
   langfuse api __schema
   ```

2. **Install the [Langfuse skill](https://github.com/langfuse/skills)** (`/langfuse`) — it packages the recommended tracing, prompt management, monitoring, and evaluator patterns from this workshop and applies them to your codebase without you hand-rolling each piece.

3. **Pick the smallest LLM-using surface** you have and wire `observe(...)` + `observeOpenAI(...)` first. Get one trace before you do anything else.

4. **Add user/session information** only once you have at least two users or two sessions of traffic — there's no point until then.

5. **Build your first dataset *from real traces, discussions with experts, or past examples*** rather than from imagination. Production behavior will tell you over time what your dataset needs to cover.

6. **Run one experiment, change one thing, rerun.** Then repeat.
