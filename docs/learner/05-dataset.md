# 05 Dataset

## Starting point

```bash
git checkout checkpoint/05-dataset
```

You have a traced, attributed, monitored app. `data/seed-dataset.json` and `scripts/seed_dataset.py` are already in the repo at this checkpoint.

Make sure `.env` has:

```bash
DATASET_NAME=dad-it-support-workshop
```

## Why build datasets

A dataset is your representation of what the system will face in production — the inputs you expect, and for each, what a good answer looks like. With a clear set of expectations written down, you can rerun the agent against them after every change and know whether you helped or hurt. A good dataset is the foundation for shipping confidently and iterating without regressing.

Learn more in the [Langfuse Academy lesson on datasets](https://langfuse.com/academy/datasets).

## Goal

Seed a first dataset that captures the kinds of requests we expect Specs to handle. To get there:

1. **Understand the item shape** — every dataset item has the same three fields, and we want ours to match the agent's actual input.
2. **Seed the hosted dataset** so it lives in Langfuse and is ready for experiments in the next step.

## Step 1 — Read the item shape

Dataset items in Langfuse follow a consistent shape — three fields, one required, two optional:

| Field | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `input` | yes | What you'd feed the agent. For us, the same `{ messages: [...] }` shape `/api/chat` accepts. |
| `expectedOutput` | optional | What a good answer would look like. Free-form — used by evaluators to compare actual vs expected. |
| `metadata` | optional | Tags or other fields for filtering and grouping (`category`, `difficulty`, etc.). |

For us, the conceptual shape of one item is:

```json
{
  "input": "How do I turn Bluetooth on on my iPhone?",
  "expectedOutput": {
    "idealAnswer": "Open Settings, tap Bluetooth, and turn the Bluetooth switch on.",
    "expectedKeywords": ["Settings", "Bluetooth", "switch", "on"]
  },
  "metadata": { "category": "iphone-bluetooth", "difficulty": "easy" }
}
```

The two fields inside `expectedOutput` answer two different evaluator questions:

- **`idealAnswer`** is the human-readable reference reply. It's what the LLM-as-a-judge correctness evaluator (chapter 06) compares the agent's actual answer against to decide whether the meaning matches.
- **`expectedKeywords`** is a small list of strings the answer *must* contain to be considered "covered the steps." A deterministic check (no model call) — fast, cheap, and great for catching regressions where the agent paraphrases away the actual menu names.

`metadata` lets us slice runs by category or difficulty later when comparing experiment runs side by side.

If you look at the actual JSON in `data/seed-dataset.json`, the `input` is the full `{ messages: [...] }` shape that `/api/chat` accepts, plus an `id` field for the dataset row. We've simplified the example above to show *what an item is*; the on-disk format is what the experiment script (step 06) can feed straight into `run_support_conversation(...)` without rewriting inputs.

## Step 2 — Seed the dataset

You have several options for getting items into a Langfuse dataset:

- **Add items manually** in the UI (Datasets → New item).
- **Upload a CSV / JSON** file via the UI.
- **Turn live production traces** into dataset items directly from the Trace view — this is the most powerful path once you have monitoring catching interesting traces.
- **Programmatic seeding** via the SDK / CLI — best for an initial bulk load like ours.

For this workshop we use the programmatic path because we already have a curated JSON file:

```bash
npm run dataset:seed
```

Open Langfuse → **Datasets**. The list view should show the new `dad-it-support-workshop` dataset with 14 items and 0 experiment runs (so far):

![Datasets list view in Langfuse — dad-it-support-workshop with 14 items and no runs yet.](../images/datasets/05-dataset-list.png)

Click into the dataset and switch to the **Items** tab. You should see every seeded item with input, expected output, and metadata columns:

![Items view of the dad-it-support-workshop dataset — all 14 rows with messages input, ideal answer + expected keywords, and category/difficulty metadata.](../images/datasets/05-dataset-items.png)

## What the starter dataset covers

- iPhone Bluetooth basics and edge cases
- iPhone Wi-Fi reconnect + "I can't see the network"
- Photo capture + WhatsApp share
- Apple Maps directions + the live-location limit
- Messages basics
- Out-of-scope (file my taxes, book my train)
- Limitation cases (passwords, live location)

If you add items later, prefer ones that match a real signal you saw in monitoring rather than items invented from scratch.

## How to verify you are done

- The dataset shows up in Langfuse with all items.
- Item inputs look like the `messages` array a real chat turn would have.
- You can articulate the failure modes the dataset covers.

## Wrap-up

Datasets are how you write down what your system is expected to handle. A good one gives you confidence to ship and to iterate without regressing. You can seed datasets via the [Langfuse CLI](https://langfuse.com/docs/api-and-data-platform/features/cli) or skill, build them from production traces in the UI, or maintain them in code like we did — the right approach depends on where your best examples come from.

Next we use this dataset to run experiments against the agent.

## End state

This is the starting point for `06-experiments`.
