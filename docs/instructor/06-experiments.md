# 06 Experiments

Learner guide: [06 Experiments](../learner/06-experiments.md)

## Instructor notes

- The key idea is reuse: the experiment runner calls the same `runSupportConversation(...)` as the web app.
- Contrast deterministic scoring (`keyword_overlap`) with LLM-as-a-judge scoring (`correctness`).
- Keep concurrency at one for workshops so traces and console output are easy to follow.

## Demo rhythm

1. Skim the numbered sections in `scripts/run-dataset.ts`.
2. Configure the Correctness evaluator for dataset runs.
3. Run `npm run dataset:run`.
4. Open the run table, per-item traces, and chart view.

## Watch for

- Correctness evaluator mapping. The query comes from dataset input, actual output from run output, and ground truth from expected output.
- Slow asynchronous evaluator results; refresh after the run finishes.
