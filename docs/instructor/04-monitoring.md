# 04 Monitoring

Learner guide: [04 Monitoring](../learner/04-monitoring.md)

## Instructor notes

- This is a no-code chapter. The value is choosing useful production signals and mapping evaluator variables correctly.
- Explain why the two monitors target different observations: out-of-scope needs the system prompt on the generation, while disagreement needs the conversation history on the agent root.
- Use the first few evaluator results as a debugging exercise, not just a pass/fail check.

## Demo rhythm

1. Configure Out-of-Scope Request on final generation observations.
2. Configure User Disagreement on the `dad-it-support-chat-turn` agent observation.
3. Send one clean in-scope turn, one out-of-scope turn, and one disagreement turn.

## Watch for

- Accidentally choosing the wrong template for User Disagreement.
- Mapping `last_user_message` to the last transcript item on a final generation; final generations include tool messages after the user turn.
